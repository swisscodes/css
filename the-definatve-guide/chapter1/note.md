# ALL CSS

Each rule has two fundamental parts: the selector and the declaration block. The declaration
block is composed of one or more declarations, and each declaration is a pairing of a property
and a value. Every stylesheet is made up of a series of these rules

e.g ![image info](../images/img1.png)

## Replaced and Nonreplaced Elements

Although CSS depends on elements, not all elements are created equal. For example, images and
paragraphs are not the same type of element. In CSS, elements generally take two forms:
replaced and nonreplaced.
Replaced elements
Replaced elements are used to indicate content that is to be replaced by something not directly
represented in the document. Probably the most familiar HTML example is the `<img>` element,
which is replaced by an image file external to the document itself. In fact, `<img>` has no actual content, as you can see in this simple example:
  
    <img src="howdy.gif" alt="Hello, friend!">

## Nonreplaced elements

The majority of HTML elements are nonreplaced elements. Their content is presented by the
user agent (generally a browser) inside a box generated by the element itself. For example,
`<span>`hi there`</span>` is a nonreplaced element, and the text “hi there” will be displayed
by the user agent. This is true of paragraphs, headings, table cells, lists, and almost everything
else in HTML.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="sheet1.css" media="screen, print">`
The `<link>` tag’s basic purpose is to allow HTML authors to associate other documents with
the document containing the `<link>` tag. CSS uses it to link stylesheets to the document.
The rel
attribute stands for relation, and in this case, the relation is stylesheet
. CSS has an optional type attribute whose default value is text/css , so
you can include type="text/css" or leave it out, whichever you prefer.

Next, we find the href attribute. The value of this attribute is the URL of your stylesheet. This
URL can be either absolute or relative—that is, either relative to the URL of the document
containing the URL, or else a complete URL that points to a unique location on the web. In our
example, the URL is relative. It could have been something absolute, like
<http://example.com/sheet1.css>
